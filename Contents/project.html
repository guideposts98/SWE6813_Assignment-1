      <p class="project_p">
          Around my second or early third year of undergraduate, I had to make a simple 2D game
          for one of my computer science courses. It was one of my first big coding projects
          as someone just starting my major. I decided to create a old memorable mobile app
          game known as "Flappy Bird". Using the various libraries and framework, I was
          able to build the entirty of the game via Java. Due to it being my first big
          project and considerable amount of time invested, it was probably my most memorable
          proudest project during my undergraduate days.

            My name is Joo Young and I am from Atlanta, Georgia. Currently, in my second year
            pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering. Through this program, I hope
            expand my expertise and sharpen my technical skills in the field of software. In
            terms of my professional career, I have worked in the financial service and
            automotive industry. Outside of work and academics, my hobbies are working out
            and reading novels.
